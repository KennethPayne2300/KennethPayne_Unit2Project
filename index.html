        <p>There are still lots of people against LGBTQ+ for no reason, with 60% of the ones that conducted the US national survey said they were being discriminated against due to their gender identity or sexual orientation and who knows how many others there were that didn't take it.</p>

        <p>There are also a lot of people who were harmed because they are LGBTQ+, in fact 23% of those who was apart of the US national survey said they were being threatened or harmed becuase of their gender identity or sexual orientation and ofc there are probably plenty more that didn't take it.</p>
